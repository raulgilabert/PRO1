I'm Catboy
I'm Owlette
I'm Gekko
And we're the PJ Masks
Let's go, PJ Masks
Gonna try-y-y together
Try-y-y together
Even if we miss the on first shot
We'll try it again and we'll get 
to the top
Let's go PJ Masks
We're gonna work together
If there's a mountain too hard 
to climb
If there's a wall that's a little
too high
If we see villains looking for a fight
One more shot and we'll rule 
the night
Gekko has super might
Owlette flies in the sky
Catboy comes to lead the way
We're the PJ Masks and we'll
save the day
Gonna try-y-y together
Try-y-y together
'Cuz We're better, we're taller, 
we're faster, we're stronger
Let's go, PJ Masks
We're gonna win together
